# Google-login-page

Creating a clone of the Google login page involves replicating the appearance and basic functionality of Google's login interface. Here's a basic description of how such a project might be structured:

User Interface Design: Design the user interface (UI) to closely resemble the layout, colors, fonts, and elements of the Google login page. This typically includes:

Logo: Include the Google logo at the top of the page.
Form Fields: Create input fields for the user to enter their email address or phone number and password.
Buttons: Design buttons for the user to sign in or create an account.
Links: Include links for "Forgot password?" and "Create account" options.
Footer: Add links to privacy policy, terms of service, and other relevant pages typically found at the bottom of the Google login page.
HTML Markup: Write HTML code to structure the elements of the login page according to the design.

Styling with CSS: Apply CSS styles to the HTML elements to achieve the desired appearance, including colors, fonts, spacing, and alignment.

Responsive Design: Ensure that the login page is responsive and looks good on various devices and screen sizes, such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
